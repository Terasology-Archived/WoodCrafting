# WoodCrafting
This module adds basic woodcrafting to Terasology. It adds various recipes (see below) and three crafting stations.

1. The Basic Woodworking Station
2. The Novice Woodworking Station
3. The Standard Woodworking Station (Same skin as Novice station)

There is also the Portable Basic Wood Station which allows for the crafting of the same recipes as the basic station. When placed as a block, it is identical to the basic station.

Items can also be crafted by hand, in fact, most of the recipes are crafted by hand.

# Crafting
At the stations, you can craft various recipes. Each successive station allows you to craft better and better items. The UI screen of the standard station looks like this:

Each station has a slightly different UI, allowing for different inputs, tools, upgrades and outputs.

It is important to remember that Wood Crafting is a system. This means that you can make your own module that houses your recipes and crafting stations so you won't have to modify Wood Crafting.

## Getting started
You're probably wondering how to actually craft an item. Here's how you get started.

1. Whip out your pickaxe (Using a shovel will not result a stone, you must use a pick)
2. Start mining dirt until you have 3-5 stones and 2-3 flint
3. Press "n" to open the hand crafting menu
4. Click the craft button of one of the available items
